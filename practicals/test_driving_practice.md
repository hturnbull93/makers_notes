# Test Driving Practice - Birthdays


**Learning Objectives**

- [X] Practice developing with TDD
- [X] Practice creating Domain Models

**Achievement Plan**

- [X] Follow the TDD process to create a birthday tracker app
- [X] Create a Domain Model from User stories
- [x] Practice writing TDD tests in `rspec`

**Evidence**

I have worked on creating an TDD'd [Birthday Tracker app](https://github.com/hturnbull93/birthdays)

## Instructions

- Test-drive an implementation of the requirements
- Make sure your code is [linted](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop)
- [Open a PR](https://services.github.com/on-demand/github-cli/open-pull-request-github) when you've finished

## Requirements

I want a program that I can load in IRB that allows me to

- Store all of my friends’ birthdays so I can keep track of them
- See them all at once with their names and birthdays each on a line in a tidy format
- Check whose birthday it is today - the program can check through the birthdays I have stored and check each one to see if it’s someone’s birthday, and tells me something like "It's Mary Poppin's birthday today! They are 124 years old!" - otherwise it won't say anything.

## More requirements:

- Test-drive extracting a birthday class
- Isolate your birthday list class using a mock for Birthday
