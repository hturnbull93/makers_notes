# Achieving Goals

[Back to Course Goals](README.md) | [Reflective Learning] | [Progress Insight]

## Goals/Learning Objectives

When setting a goal/learning objective:

- What are you learning at the moment and why is it important?
- Is your goal clearly defined and reasonable in scope? SMART.
- Are there any other goals to usefully consider?

## Achievement Plans

What actions do you take in order to move towards the goal, and record progress:

- What's your plan to get to your goal and is it reasonably achievable?
- What learning strategies and resources are you considering using?
- Is the evidence you plan to collect relevant and would it be convincing?
- Is there any other evidence to usefully consider?

## Evidence

Evidence is important to show that you have made progress:

- How did your plan go?
- How are you measuring your learning progress at the moment?
- How do you know how good you are at the skill you're trying to learn?

### Examples of Evidence

| Type of Objective | Examples of Evidence  
| --- | ---
| Knowledge | Reports of knowledge acquired, as in essays, examinations, oral presentations, audiovisual presentations; annotated bibliographies.
| Understanding | Examples of utilisation of knowledge in solving problems, as in action projects, research projects with conclusions and recommendations, plans for curriculum change, etc.
| Skills | Performance exercises, video-taped performances, etc, with ratings by observers
| Attitudes | Attitudinal rating scales; performance in real situations, role playing, simulation games, critical incident-cases, etc, with feedback from participants and /or observers.
| Values | Value rating scales; performance in value clarification groups, critical incident cases, simulation exercises, etc, with feedback from participants and/or observers.
