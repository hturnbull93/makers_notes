# Reviews

[Back to Course Goals](README.md) | [Source](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EgbszeKZ1JZGwy_uWxRJE1zeiedQ9oBhfdkau2Z34OU)

Reviews are an opportunity to practice , and to feedback on your coding processes.

Reviews are a technical assessment simulating a technical interview.

The reviewer roleplays as a product owner with a set of non-technical requirements. The developer uses the Makers dev process to convert these requirements into a working, tested, well-written application.

The Review assesses how well a developer:

- Converts fuzzy, human wants and needs into technical requirements.
- Writes good tests.
- Writes clean code.
- Debugs when things go wrong.
- Delivers value to the customer in an Agile way.

## Process

Use the same process as the [Process Workshops](/process_workshops.md).

## 6 May

[Full Feedback](/reviews/2020-05-06-feedback.pdf) | [Recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLyvq_DT1-w)

Feedback Summary:

- Increment on previous code in TDD, rather than rewriting a new solution to satisfy all tests.

## 21 May

[Full Feedback](/reviews/2020-05-21-feedback.pdf) | [Recording]()

Feedback Summary:

- Think of the general case (the simplest thing someone would actually do).
- In this example, a single array:
  - [0], low of 1 and high of 2.
  - [1], low of 1 and high of 2.
  - [2], low of 1 and high of 2.
  - [3], low of 1 and high of 2.
- Avoid specific cases until later.
