# Meditation

[Back to Course Goals](README.md)

## Practice

- Be sitting
- Angle your head down and slowly close eyes
- Do not judge your thoughts

**What can you sense**

- What can you hear
- What can you see
- What can you smell
- What can you taste
- What can you feel

**Count your breath**
- Up to ten
- Inhale 1, Exhale 2, and so on
- If the mind wanders bring it back and start again where you last remember being 


## Aspects of Meditation

<!-- Two other things I can not recall -->

**Breath Party**
- Treat your breath as the most important guest at a party

**Bliss Field**
- A wonderful state of mind

**Contemplation**
- Problem solving, thinking about stuff
- Should not be part of meditation 


## Emotions

Feeling the way you feel is okay


### Ways we process emotions unconciously 

<!-- there was something before this -->

**Suppression**
- Pushing down emotions about things
- Must come out sooner or later
- Often in behaviours and physiological things like headaches

**Expression**
- Best to express our selves in a responsible way
- Try not to vent in a downward spiral

**Escape**
- Engaging in excess of anything
- Avoidance and procrastination


## Breathing

### 4 7 8 breathing

Helps in achieving 'heart rate variability'

- Inhale for 4 counts
- Hold for 7 counts, 
- Exhale for 8 counts

## Habits

**Consistent repetitions forms habits**
- The more repetitions the easier the task is to do
- If you get past the honeymoon phase (1-7) and the druge phase (7-30) it will become a habit

**Stick to it**
- Don't skip a habit forming activity twice
- if you skp twice, your new habit is ***not*** doing the thing you're trying to cultivate

**Excuses for not meditating**
- **There's not enough time:** If you don't have ten minutes, you don't have time for anything else
- **I can't turn off my thoughts:** Not supposed to, keep the pupp brain on track
- **Can't sit still:** Move if you want, meditation will help you practice being still
