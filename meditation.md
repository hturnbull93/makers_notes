<!-- there was something before this -->

**Supression**
- Pushing down emotions about things
- Must come out sooner or later
- Often in behaviours and physiological things like headaches

**Expression**
- Venting
- Body language
- Having our say
- Best to express our selves in a responsible way

Feeling the way you feel is okay
