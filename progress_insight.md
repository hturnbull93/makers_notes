# How to gain insight into your progress

[Source](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/goals/progress_insight.md)

Add to your evidence for the skills you cultivate and the goals you achieve.


## I can make software

Weak

- [x] Explain it to someone who's been doing it longer, do they agree?

- [x] Watch a video of someone doing the skill. Can you follow what they're doing?


Moderate

- [ ] Watch a video of someone doing the skill. Is it like your process? What are the differences and why?

- [ ] Do a programming exercise and honestly assess your progress — have you really used the skill? E.g. for TDD, did you really test everything before you implemented it? Where did you fall down? The more complex the task, the stronger the evidence is you're doing well.

- [ ] Teach someone else the skill — do they pick it up? Review them after a few days, how are they doing?


Strong

- [ ] Send a video of yourself using the skill to a coach and ask them "If I did this in an interview, would it come across well?"

- [ ] Send a codebase you've written to a coach and ask them "If I submitted this as a tech test, do you think I'd get through to the next stage?"



## My teams succeed

Weak

- [ ] Can you explain how a software team should work? What responsibilities it has and how it executes them?

- [x] Have you built some software in a team?

- [x] Can you get work done in a pair while navigating?

- [x] Can you get work done in a pair while driving?

- [ ] Calculate your velocity as a team — compare it to the velocity of other teams. Are you faster or slower? Can you identify why?


Moderate

- [x] Ask your pair for frank and honest feedback after a pairing session.

- [ ] Invite someone to observe you pairing — ask them for feedback.

- [x] Can you get work done and learn while pairing with someone with more experience than you? less experience than you?

- [ ] Share your code with a peer and watch them read the code and figure out how it works — can they do it easily without prompting?

- [ ] Find a problem or inefficiency in the way you're working as a team and implement a solution. Does it go through well? Does it solve the problem? Are the team happy with it?


Strong

- [ ] Share your code with a peer and ask them to implement a new feature in it without your assistance — is it easy? Can they do it without changing much of your code?

- [ ] Share your code with a coach and ask them, "Would you want to work on a team with someone who wrote this code?"

- [ ] Submit a non-trivial change to an open source project — does it get merged? What change requests do you get?

- [ ] Pair with someone you think is a great pair programmer. Ask them for frank feedback, "What went well here?", "What's holding me back?"

- [ ] Ask a coach to observe you pairing. Ask them "If we paired like this in an interview, would the interviewer be impressed?"

- [ ] Ask a member of your team, frankly, whether this is the best team they've worked on at Makers. If it isn't, why not?


## I am equipped for long term growth


Weak

- [ ] Do you feel like you know where you need to get to by the end of the course, and how you're going to get there?

- [ ] Can you explain the core concepts to yourself?

- [ ] Can you draw a diagram of how things work?

- [ ] Can you understand a simple program someone else wrote using these concepts?

- [ ] Explain your direction in the software industry to someone and why it's important to you.

- [ ] Have a conversation about a technical topic you're interested in. Does it feel compelling?


Moderate

- [ ] Explain the core concepts to someone who's been doing it longer, do they agree?

- [ ] Make a list of questions you'd expect someone who understood the subject to be able to answer. Answer them and ask someone experienced to review your answers.

- [ ] Go through a complex program involving these concepts and explain everything that is going on to someone else. Do they understand?


Strong

- [ ] Go through a complex program involving these concepts and explain everything that is going on to someone else. Do they understand?

- [ ] Go through a complex program involving these concepts with a coach and explain everything that is going on. Ask a coach "If I said this in an interview, would my interviewer think I understood what I was talking about?"
