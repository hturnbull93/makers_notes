## GitHub CV

When you apply for Makers internal roles on the Hub. You fill in a form that is essentially a simple cover letter.

The partnerships team makes a shortlist from these.

The only thing a hiring partner sees after you are shortlisted by the partnership team.

The Github CV is a mix between a cover letter and a CV.

It is more in depth:

- Personal Profile
- Projects
- Skills (Generally soft skills) (problem solving)
- Work experience
- (no education?)
- Hobbies

When you write your skills you go into a bit more detail:

- Here is my skill.
- Here is an example of how I used that skill.
- Here is why it would be useful to the company.

Personal profile:

- will be more personal than formal, as that will make it more memorable.
- State your degree

"Due to my experience in Agile/XP/pair programming I am familiar with working in pressured team environments."
