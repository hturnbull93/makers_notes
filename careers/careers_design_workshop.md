## Questions

### What is the key moment or series of moments that ignited your decision to come to Makers

I wanted to do more with what I was already doing (WordPress management/light development).

A friend suggested Makers, I went to a demo day and thought it would be a very good thing to do.

The projects I saw there I thought I would have no clue how to do myself at the time so the course would definitely offer me much in terms of learning.

### What is something that tech makes possible that gets you excited

I am interested in machine learning. I would like to do more on that, especially language models.

### What five companies could you imagine yourself working for your best days

I would like to work for Google. Or a web development agency. Anywhere that allows pets and flexible working environments (not just in a cubicle, but I would like my own desk).

### What are the non-negotiable you must have in your next role

Commuting distance: 1 hour each way maximum. I am comfortable remote working.

Opportunity for self led learning/personal skills development, supported by the company explicitly.

### What is this career change really about

Getting skilled up and equipping myself with the skill of learning in the context of software development.

Getting paid.
