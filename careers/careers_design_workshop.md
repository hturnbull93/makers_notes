## Questions

### What is the key moment or series of moments that ignited your decision to come to Makers

I wanted to do more with what I was already doing (WordPress management/light development).

A friend suggested Makers, I went to a demo day and thought it would be a very good thing to do.

The projects I saw there I thought I would have no clue how to do myself at the time so the course would definitely offer me much in terms of learning.

### What is something that tech makes possible that gets you excited

I am interested in machine learning. I would like to do more on that, especially language models.

### What five companies could you imagine yourself working for your best days

I would like to work for Google.

Or a web development agency.

Anywhere that allows a flexible working environments (not just in a cubicle, but I would like my own desk).

Other companies:

- Monzo
- Thoughtmachine
- Babylon

### What are the non-negotiable you must have in your next role

Commuting distance: 1 hour each way maximum. I am comfortable remote working.

Opportunity for self led learning/personal skills development, supported by the company explicitly.

### What is this career change really about

Getting skilled up and equipping myself with the skill of learning in the context of software development.

Getting paid.

## 12 Habits of Highly Effective Job Role Creators

### 1. Focus on the course content and deeply understand the fundamentals

Go over the course challenges again to solidify your technical understanding.

The course is everything you need to do to get a job, so understand everything and you are all good.

### 2. Aim to get really good at one language

Choose one thing (JS or Ruby I guess, or commit hard to another one).

More Front-End roles at the moment. It may be easier to transition to full stack from Front-End.

### 3. Check out Meetups

(Virtual) meetups are great for networking, and meeting employers, or people inside companies that you can get a referral from.

In the last month all Makers hired were from a  meetup referral.

How to make an impression at a (virtual) meetup:

- Ask questions that interest you (and hopefully impress others).
- Some companies do not hire on job boards.
- Sending DMs in Zoom.
- Stalk people's Twitter/LinkedIn.
- Introduce yourself to someone you find interesting.

### 4. Build a kickass portfolio

Build projects that look good and work well.

And build a portfolio site (as a portfolio piece and portfolio itself).

### 5. Write a blog

Already on it.

But keep going with it.

Tweet your articles. Wield them towards your things

### 6. Have a north star

Stick to your guns on your requirements.

Always have your aim, and always move towards it.

### 7. Use LinkedIn as your primary tool

Search for bootcamp grads, see where they work, connect with their companies teams, (as they have hired bootcamp grads before).

### 8. Don't rely on your CV or cover letters

Connect with people who will be involved in your hire.

Find a companies github, look at their issues. Fix one.

### 9. Read about wider issues in tech

Understand the context of your work.

Have a favourite blog.

Read Dev.to.

Listen to podcast CodeNewbie.

### 10. Dig into CS fundamentals

Algorithms course from Alice.

Book: Cracking the coding interview

### 11. Trust your process

Honour where you are at and move forward in your journey.
