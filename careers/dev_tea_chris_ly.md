## What is DevOps

Systems administrations to do with deployment of technologies.

A lot of web applications use existing cloud services, so a lot of stuff to do with DevOps is hidden away.

Merging development and operations together.

## Spectrix

Look for people who are willing to learn, and people who are decent people.

Interviewing for culture fit is a little dangerous as you may reduce diversity.
