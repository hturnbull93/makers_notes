## Research

### 50 companies you would love to work for:

- Reapply every other month.
- If you get feedback from their engineers tell them how you have implemented it.
- Close the gap between their hiring bar and your performance.

### 50 companies you would should work for:

Training and Culture.

- Have they hired bootcamp grads.
- Have those grads stayed.
- Have they progressed.

They hire, or make, great devs.

- Where do the engineering team come from.
- Where do the engineering team go on to.

Tech

- What tech do you want to use? Why?
- Can you join using a tech you know, or learn a new tech you don't know?

### 50 companies you would should never work for

Check company on Glassdoor:

- Check for "Anonymous Employee"
- Check for cons in a "positive" way
- Reviews posted at similar times
- Lots of bad reviews

## Daily Prep

Every day go to your list and prepare for 30 min max.

Take 1 company per day (to start with).

With the templates, create:

- Your cover letter (changing only the **Why** section you want to join **Them** )
- LinkedIn connection Messages
- Longer direct email/LinkedIn message

## Website Applications

If you only see one file submit, merge your cover letter with your CV.

## LinkedIn Volume Connects

You should have your template ready:

> Hi **NAME**,
>
> Do you know if youâ€™re hiring Junior JavaScript Developers at present?
>
> Iâ€™ve been upskilling myself with React, as Iâ€™d love to apply to work with you at **COMPANY**.
>
> Would you mind if I shared my portfolio with you for feedback? Iâ€™d be grateful for any help to improve.
>
> Thanks,
> Harry

As a junior the value is you can get feedback, take on that advice, and make something with it.

Search for the company on LinkedIn, within that, search for anyone who might care about your CV.

> (developer OR engineer OR engineering OR hiring OR recruit OR HR)

Filter for UK.

Target HR, recruiters, leads and managers as priority.

Send them all the message template. Mass volume.

There is really no one who is too senior.

The worst thing is that they just ignore you.

When you come across a Director, send your longer message:

> Hi **NAME**,
>
> Thank you for connecting with me. I wondered if you could give me some advice if you have a moment, Iâ€™d love to join Qubit as a Junior JavaScript Developer because I think getting to work on a customer insight platform that uses machine learning to give people a more immersive shopping experience would be really exciting. Plus your companyâ€™s values of collaboration, resilience, and the idea you can make a positive impact with your platform aligns with the type of team Iâ€™m looking to be apart of in my first role.
>
> What would be your best advice for a junior developer to stand the best chance of being invited for an interview with you? What would you suggest I learn?
>
> Since I graduated from Makerâ€™s Academy, Iâ€™ve been learning React and Redux - So far Iâ€™ve built 5 small projects to showcase my current skill level.
>
> Hereâ€™s my portfolio on GitHub (INSERT ONCE DONE), Iâ€™ve also attached my CV in case youâ€™re curious.
>
> Iâ€™d be grateful for any feedback you have on how I might improve and increase my chances of being invited for an interview with you and your team in the future.
>
> Thank you in advance for any words of wisdom or help you can give.
>
> Have a great day! ðŸ˜„
>
> Harry

And attach you CV.

If they don't come back send a longer message to follow up a couple of days in the future.

Avoid recruiters, to help their costs down go direct.

Consider LinkedIn Premium Business for unlimited search

## Direct Speculative Emails

> Hi COMPANY NAME,
>
> I'm Harry, a Junior JavaScript Developer who has recently graduated from Makers Academy. I wondered if youâ€™re hiring at the moment for Junior Developers? If you are, Iâ€™d love to be considered to join your team. 
>
> Iâ€™ve attached a cover letter along with my CV, describing why Iâ€™d love to join you and what skills I can bring to your team. Below youâ€™ll find links to my GitHub, Portfolio, and Linkedin, where youâ€™ll be able to learn more about me and all of the projects Iâ€™ve created.
>
> GitHub: https://github.com/hturnbull93/  
> Portfolio: (INSERT ONCE DONE)  
> LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/harry-turnbull/
>
> If now isnâ€™t the right time for whatever reason, Iâ€™d be grateful for any feedback or advice to increase my chances of landing an interview with you in the future. I also hope you donâ€™t mind me reapplying again in the near future, once Iâ€™ve had a chance to upskill myself even further.
