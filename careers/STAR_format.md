# STAR Format - Careers Workshop

[All Workshops](README.md)

## Using the STAR Format

Situation, Task, Action, Result, (Benefit).

They are interested in the soft skill that underlies what you did. Benefit is the general application.

Address something in the job spec.

Give a situation from previous job, set the context.

Example of particular task and action carried out.

What resulted from that action.

Link the general skill used to how it would benefit them generally.

## Checklist

- Have I told them why I love the company? or linked to a blog or project i am interested in? (First paragraph).
- Have I linked skill that I have an to example?
- Have I then linked skill and example to point from the job description or company value?
- Have I used the above to explain why I would be a good fit for this role? (At the end of each paragraph).

## Worksheet

### Situation

Think of a situation similar to what the interviewer is asking you about that had a successful outcome. It doesn’t necessarily have to be work related as long as it’s relevant. Remember to include the who, what, where, when and how.

### Task

Describe the task you were responsible for in that situation. Keep it specific but concise. Make sure to highlight any specific challenges you faced.

### Action

This is the part where you describe exactly what you did. How did you complete the task you were assigned? Remember to focus on what you did and highlight traits (qualities) that a hiring manager will find desirable (initiative, teamwork, leadership, dedication, etc).

Try and think about three different steps to explain the action you took.

### Result

This is where you get to be introspective. Share what the outcome of the situation was and how you specifically contributed to that outcome. What did you accomplish? What did you learn? What were the results of your actions?

### TELL ME ABOUT A TIME WHEN…

#### YOU WERE PROUD OF SOMETHING YOU ACHIEVED

This could be anything from a hobby, a tech project, something you did at work or school.

1. I performed at an international festival with my improv group Improbotics, demonstrating our AI technology to an audience of over 100.

2. 

3. 

#### YOU ENJOYED WHAT YOU DID

This could be tech and programming but also include examples from other areas of your life which are good skills to have in tech e.g. working in a business or STEM subjects.

1. I enjoyed my work for the Nursery Theatre, I was very glad to be able to work doing things I enjoyed (graphic and web design), for a charity that supports one of my hobbies (improv).

2. During my time as Project Manager at Freedom Tech, I was tasked to distrubute white label marketing assets to partners and clients. I created automated workflows for the genration, allowing me to fulfil far more sets of assets than if it were done manually.

3. 

#### WHEN YOU WERE A LEADER

1. At Makers Academy we wanted to use React as part of our final project. However the team needed to learn React. As the most experienced React developer, I took it upon myself to help my team fill any knowledge gaps, by discussing examples I had created with them to test their knowledge of the technology. This accelerated our development greatly.

2. Later during the final project I led the team through a sprint with the aim to refactor the entire codebase, going from 31 tests with 66% code coverage to 57 tests with 97% coverage, a significant improvement.

3. When I directed an Edinburgh fringe show.

#### WHEN YOU WERE CHALLENGED

1. When I directed my Edinburgh Fringe show, I had never taken a show up to the fringe before.

2. 

3. 

#### WHEN YOU FAILED

1. 

2. 

3. 

#### WHEN YOU WORKED IN A TEAM

1. During my final project we worked in a group of 6. We used Agile and XP techniques to organise the workflow. 

2. 

3. 

#### WHEN YOU SOLVED A PROBLEM

1. The Nursery Theatre's Google Ads campaigns were improperly set up. I recreated the campaigns which led to an increase of 7 times the click through rate.

2. 

3. 

#### WHEN YOU EXPERIENCED A CONFLICT

Think of examples to describe times when you have worked with difficult people or when you think you could have communicated better. In the result think about a positive outcome or what you learned from the experience.

1. While working for certain clients I had to persuade them away from UI design decisions what would lead for poor UX for their users.

2. 

3. 

#### WHAT YOU’D DO DIFFERENTLY

Think of an example of something you think you could have done better (education, a tech project, a job, a team project, a hobby).
