# Kate Morris - Dev Tea

[All Workshops](README.md)

## Background

[Kate's LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kate-morris-a3962943/)

Wonder why you trained with makers after having stidued computer science and had a previous career as a software developer?

## Deloitte

Clear career path, reviews in may, which decide promotions.

In order to be promoted oyu must perform expectationally for 6 mos.

Achieve learning goals, mentor people, take responsibility for parts of project.

Quarterly reviews are for flagging up what you haven't been able to do in order to get promoted/progress.

## Consultant Developer

Day to day bases it's no different to product developer.

You simply are able to switch around projects. There is scope to request exposure to different parts.

Smaller software houses have maybe only one product, and everyone knows a lot about it, so good to be a beginner there.

As you grow, you might want to work for somewhere with lots of products to seek particular things.

## What person is right for Deloitte

Skilled, perhaps flexible to move around for meetings etc.

## Junior vs Mid vs Senior

Juniors are given tasks to make small changes which are merged in after review.

It's unlikely they can do anything that breaks the system.

Mids look after Juniors and show them what they are up to.

Seniors do the same for Mids and also see to the vision and direction of the project.

## Advice for jobhunters

The current scenario is not our fault.

If you don't get a role immediately, continue studying and practising. Then you can apply your knowledge in interviews.

Show people what you can do by doing CodeWars Katas.

Katas are nice to showcase your style.

Relatively high level Katas might come up in interviews, so good to practice.

Projects are good to show off frameworks, and teamwork, and work in existing codebases.

Livestream or record yourself doing Katas or other work.
