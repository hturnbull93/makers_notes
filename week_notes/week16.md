## Retrospective

### Achievements this week

- [x] Apply for 5 jobs this week.

### Score: 7

#### Reasons for Score

- I am glad I maintained 5 job applications this week. I also feel that the quality of my cover letters has improved, they have become more organic, less "sectiony", and I have used STAR format to address parts of the job app in them.
- While I'm glad I did the job apps in that way, it's unclear if the improvement will pay off (fingers crossed). It took much longer to do.
- There turns out to be more to the Statue Project data processing than I first thought, so even though I have made progress, I am not able to finish everything I set out to do for it this week.
