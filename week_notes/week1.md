## Retrospective

### Achievements this week

- [x] Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods
- [x] Debug some programs that have errors in them, using an effective debugging process
- [x] Describe basic OO principles like encapsulation and SRP
- [x] Pair using the driver/navigator style

### Score: 8

#### Reasons for Score

- I feel confident about the Test-drive using objects and methods and pairing from working on the Boris Bikes project.
- The debugging workshop gave me a good understanding of how to debug effectively using tighten loop, get visibility and fix to work through error messages systematically.
- Though I haven't covered the OO principles in detail, I feel I have had enough exposure to these concepts through the Boris Bikes project, to be able to reasonably explain them.

### Material to re-cover

- I would read more about encapsulation and SRP to make sure my understanding is rock solid.
- I would get more practice with implementing unit tests in TDD as I feel I don't use them as often as I should, but I am not sure.
- I would read more about mocking and doubles in TDD, as I haven't got to the point where I have actually used those yet. I would then apply them in a small project.
