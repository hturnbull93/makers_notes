## Retrospective

### Achievements this week

- [x] Build a simple web app
- [x] Follow an effective debugging process for web applications
- [x] Explain the basics of how the web works (e.g. request/response, HTTP, HTML, CSS)
- [x] Explain the MVC pattern

### Score: 9

#### Reasons for Score

- I feel I have a good handle on how the web works. Fortunately I was able to focus more deeply on HTTP response/request, Sinatra, and Rack, as I already have a knowledge of HTML/CSS from previous working life.
- I feel comfortable with the  MVC pattern, having worked on this in the afternoon challenge a lot.
- I have constructed simple web apps using Sinatra in the afternoon challenges and skills workshops, and feel comfortable recreating these.
- I feel confident debugging using Tighten loop, Get visibility, Single fix steps.

### Material to re-cover

- Work further on the battles app, could make a good portfolio piece!
