## Dana’s Talk

- Creative risk taking
- Information section
- Pairing exercise
- Sharing with the group

You are not stupid, you are being challenged with something I can overcome.
Take care of your sleep, and you take care of yourself.
You are on this course to transform yourself, and change is not always comfortable.
Everyone you meet is a font of information that you do not know if you know.
Ambivert, a delicate balance of extroversion and introversion.
Pomodoro is a suggestion, find your own balance.
Be kind to yourself, allow vices, spend your willpower on learning.
Remain connected with your loved ones and friends, they will support you.
Compare yourself to others only if it is helpful, but compare yourself today to yourself yesterday and see if you have improved.
Focus on the learning, not on the job search. 
Worry is a false sense of control. Control what you can and do not worry about things out of your control.
Act without assuming you know how people feel, how they thinkthink, or what they might know, Ask instead.
Practice things you find uncomfortable.
Makers are what they are because they are good at it, but challenge them to improve.
If you don’t share how you feel, nothing will change.

Dana’s medium @chiefjoyofficer

### Communication

Before each pair check in with each other, how are they?
Not instructions on how to fix the problem, just a user manual on how to act in that pair.
Feedback one thing they did great, one thing they can work on.

### Meditation session after lunch

Was really good

## Meet the coaches

Katerina

- Been with makers for a year and a half
- Used to teach EFL
- Joined codebar for developers, good for networking
- Did a software apprenticeship similar to makers

Eóin

Tatsiana

- Studied computer science
- Worked at Monzo
- Then went to Makers, here a year
- Volunteers with coding organisation

### Questions

When do we start coding problems?

- Starts on Tuesday

How do remote sessions work?

- Whole group intro then split into breakout rooms
- Coaches are there to make sure Devs have understood objectives and have what they need to work properly

How often do we switch tutors?

- Same coach for at least a week, though do try to rotate coaches to get a lot of experiences and coaching styles
- Generally two week blocks

How is our progress tracked?

- Self led progress tracking
- Devs will learn how to track themselves
- Self led learning is for us to decide what we have learned from point to point
- There is a scaffold of the course with key objectives, though how we tackle that is self led. Earlier on they are more broken down, and later they are less scaffolded
- Learning how to break down your own goals into sub-goals is a skill in itself, coaches can soundboard our goal breakdowns.
- Get to know your coaches, speak to them often

On weekend challenges how much time should we allocate?

- Start the challenge sooner rather than later (saturday morning), will be different time for everyone
- This allows you to gauge the length of time it need
- More hours doesn’t mean success, as long as you plan properly you will understand more

Laptops 

- Laptops are wiped clean, so everything needs to be installed
- Coaches can help with installation issues

Coach availability

- 9:30 to 12:30
- Head into the #coaches channel

## Succeeding at Makers and beyond

[Read about goals here](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/goals/README.md).

What does success mean for me?
Set myself a goal, then achieve it.
Scaffolding is there for technical and EQ skills to begin with
Then define own goals and subgoals more and more
Main goal of Makers is to learn how to learn fast. Get good at learning.
Go from not knowing, to knowing some, to knowing much.
Junior Developers are Knowledge Workers.

### Knowledge Work 

- Ever changing
- High amount of new knowledge to apply to job
- Junior Devs - 60% of time is looking up stuff you do not know to learn
- Experienced Knowledge Workers - 38% is learning
- A lot is breaking new ground, and making new things from existing examples
- Getting better at finding things out
- Getting better at breaking down and setting goals
- How you approach and solve problems is more important than the solution to the problem
- Flexibility and the ability to approach new problems and find solutions is a very transferable and employable skill

### Self directed learning competencies assessment

Plan a learning objective.
Do something to make progress.
Reflect on what you have done.
All learning you do to benefit yourself.

### The Learning Mountain

- Skill acquisition starts from 0, then climb a mountain as skill increases.
- Over time the skill reduces. The skill must be practiced to keep it sharp.
- On the way up the mountain everyone takes a different path.
- Learners go through peaks and troughs.
- Coaches can help you work out where you are, and help you out of troughs.
- Where you are today does not tell you where you will be tomorrow.
- Prior understanding affects progress.
- External factors, like COVID affect our mindset and feelings.
- Learning is new shoots on the tree of our knowledge. We all have our own unique tree from our own life experience.
- A super peak is about the depth of learning. The more troughs you go through on the way up, the greater your understanding. You have climbed more overall.
- Helping people out of their troughs helps you ascend to super peak. Being able to impart knowledge requires a deeper understanding than you need for just yourself.
- Software development teams act as true team-sport teams. No one can do it alone, you need each other to motivate you.

### Impostor Syndrome

You will come to a point when you feel you don’t know things someone in your position should, and you feel like an impostor.
It is never embarrassing to learn, or to ask for help learning. Even things that may seem very basic.

### Day to day

Morning
- Peer groups - Learn about setting goals
- Goal directed project work
- Workshops from coaches
- Mini projects
- Coach chats

Afternoon
- Meditation after lunch, some time for you.
- Pair challenges, different challenges, different pairings
