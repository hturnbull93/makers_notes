## Retrospective

### Achievements this week

- [x] Build a simple web app with a database
- [x] Follow an effective debugging process for database applications
- [x] Explain the basics of how databases work (e.g. tables, SQL, basic relationships)

### Score: 8

#### Reasons for Score

- Given this was a 4 day week I was a little concerned about covering enough material, but it was alright in the end as I was able to do a lot of self led learning over the bank holiday.

### Material to re-cover

- Practice more about Web Apps interactive with Database by doing the Diary App.
