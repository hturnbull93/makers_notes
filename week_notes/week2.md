## Retrospective

### Achievements this week

- [x] Use all of week 1's skills
- [x] Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
- [x] Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
- [x] Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
- [x] Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback

### Score: 9

#### Reasons for Score

- I feel that I have done quite well on this week's LOs. I feel challenged, but I think everything that I have learned I have understood well.
- I have covered a good amount of skills workshops, particularly to do with OO and refactoring.
- I have also covered a good amount on mocking and isolated tests.
- While I haven't had that much practice on creating dependency injections, I feel I can explain the concept.

### Material to re-cover

- I would like to learn more about OO principles.
- I would like to practice more refactoring to good OO design.
- Perhaps it would be good to go over the skills workshops from this week to fill in anything I am missing.
