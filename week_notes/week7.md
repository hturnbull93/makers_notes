## Retrospective

### Achievements this week

- [x] Build a front-end app in Javascript
- [x] Work competently in Javascript
- [x] Reason about asynchronous behaviour in Javascript

### Score: 6

#### Reasons for Score

- I have done well in self led learning, however I feel that I have had trouble being challenged during the group project in the afternoons, (although I have made progress during the weekend challenge)

### Material to re-cover

- More practice on APIs, async/await, promises, and setTimeout.
