## Retrospective

### Achievements this week

- [x] Test drive a simple front-end web app with Javascript
- [x] Follow an effective process for learning a new language
- [x] Read and write JavaScript syntax
- [x] Understand the `this` keyword
- [x] Understand Ajax request and response
- [x] Understand control flow of callbacks

### Score: 8

#### Reasons for Score

- I'm happy with my ability to create simple front-end apps using JS, as I have demonstrated in Thermostat and Bowling Scorecard.
- I'm satisfied with the rate at which I have become comfortable with JS, practice makes perfect though.
- I understand AJAX and have implemented it with API calls to openweathermap.org in Thermostat, and I understand in theory how this could be used to hook up a remote database, but I haven't actually implemented that to save Thermostat state.

### Material to re-cover

- Create and hook up a database to save Thermostat state.
