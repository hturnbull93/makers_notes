## Tuesday

### Debugging Workshop

[Skills Workshop - week 1 - debugging 1](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/master/week-1/debugging_1)

### Learning Objectives

- Learn a systematic approach to debugging

### Achievement plan

- Attempt to debug the examples provided in the skills workshop
- Follow the systematic approach described below

### Evidence

I have completed the first three tests of the debugging examples

## Notes

### To debug, use a systematic approach

**Tighten the loop**
- Use error messages to find the line the bug is coming from.
- If that is in `rspec` results then check the rspec test and see what the test expects.
- Check up through the results to find the source.

**Get visibility**
- Use `p` to inspect things that you suspect lead up to the bug.

**Single fix**
- Once you have worked out the _one_ thing that is wrong, make the fix

**DO NOT** try things at random and see if that fixes the code.
