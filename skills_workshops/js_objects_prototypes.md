## Exercises

### Objects and JSON

The following is how objects are made in JS. They are similar to Ruby's hashes, but can be accessed with dot notation as well as bracket notation.

The structure of an object is JSON, JavaScript Object Notation, which can often be in its own separate file.

```js
var cat = {
  sound: "meow!",
  legs: 4
};

console.log(cat.sound); // meow!
console.log(cat.legs); // 4

console.log(cat.['sound']); // meow!
console.log(cat.['legs']); // 4

var dog = { sound: "woof!", legs: 4 };

console.log(dog.sound); // woof!
console.log(dog.legs); // 4

dog.sound = "bork!";

console.log(dog.sound); // bork!
```

### Functions and Parameters

Functions (methods, when within the scope of an object), are similar to Ruby's methods.

Functions _MUST_ be called with the parentheses, even if there are no arguments.

They can be stored in variables.

```js
var sayHello = function() {
  return "Hello!";
};

sayHello(); // Hello!

sayHello; // Æ’ () {
          //   return "Hello!";
          // }

var sayHiTo = function(name) {
  return "Hi " + name + "!";
};

sayHiTo("Dave"); // Hi Dave!
```

They can be declared as functions, the following is equivalent:

```js
function sayHello() {
  return "Hello!";
};

sayHello(); // Hello!

function sayHiTo(name) {
  return "Hi " + name + "!";
};

sayHiTo("Dave"); // Hi Dave!
```

In ES6 they can be declared as arrow functions, which is longer for non anonymous functions, but shorter for anonymous functions.

The following is equivalent:

```js
var sayHello = () => {
  return "Hello!";
};

sayHello(); // Hello!

var sayHiTo = (name) => {
  return "Hi " + name + "!";
};

sayHiTo("Dave"); // Hi Dave!
```

### Assigning Objects Keys with Functions

Keys of an objects can be assigned with functions, which can then be called by using dot notation on the object.

```js
var sayMeow = function() {
  return "Meow!";
};

sayMeow(); // Meow!

var cat = { legs: 4 };

// Assign the function to cat.speak
cat.speak = sayMeow;

cat.speak(); // Meow!
```

Objects can include functions when created too.

```js
var cat = {
  speak: function() {
    return "Meow!";
  },
  legs: 4
};

cat.speak(); // Meow!
```

This is where arrow functions work well. As they reduce the amount of characters.

cat.speak holds an anonymous function.

The following is equivalent.

```js
var cat = {
  speak: () => {
    return "Meow!";
  },
  legs: 4
};

cat.speak(); // Meow!
```

### Referring to an objects properties with `this`

The this keyword will look for the key in the scope of the object that has the method being called.

Here, `this.legs` refers to `cat.legs`.

```js
var cat = {
  speak: function() {
    return "I have " + this.legs + " legs! Meow!";
  },
  legs: 4
};

cat.speak(); // I have 4 legs! Meow!
cat.legs = 5;
cat.speak(); // I have 5 legs! Meow!
```

The `this` keyword is relative to scope the function is being called from, even if it was defined elsewhere.

```js
var myCatSpeak = function() {
  return "I have " + this.legs + " legs! Meow!";
};

var cat = {
  legs: 4
};

cat.speak = myCatSpeak;

cat.speak(); // I have 4 legs! Meow!
```

### The Constructor/Prototype Pattern

JS does not have the exact same approach to classes as Ruby does. Instead you can define a function that creates an object (constructor), and then add methods to its base template (prototype).

Here we can set the number of legs for a cat with an argument when calling `new Cat(4)`.

The `this` keyword is used to assign keep the variable in the scope of that particular cat instance.

```js
var Cat = function(legs) {
  this.legs = legs;
};

Cat.prototype.speak = function() {
  return "I have " + this.legs + " legs! Meow!";
};

var cat = new Cat(4);
cat.speak(); // I have 4 legs! Meow!

var otherCat = new Cat(5);
otherCat.speak(); // I have 5 legs! Meow!

otherCat.legs = 6;
otherCat.speak(); // I have 6 legs! Meow!
```

Of course, creating the function with the `function` keyword also works.

```js
function Cat(legs) {
  this.legs = legs;
};

Cat.prototype.speak = function() {
  return "I have " + this.legs + "legs! Meow!";
};

var cat = new Cat(4);
cat.speak(); // I have 4 legs! Meow!
```

### The Factory Function Pattern

Here, the factory function pattern is used. The `Cat` function creates an object that can return speak and legs, but it is told to do so with return. Calling `cat.speak()` returns the speak function so that is what gets called.

```js
function Cat(legs) {
  var legs = legs;

  function speak() {
    return "I have " + this.legs + " legs! Meow!";
  }

  return {
    legs: legs,
    speak: speak
  }
}

var cat = new Cat(4);
cat.speak(); // I have 4 legs! Meow!
```

### The Class Pattern

In ES6 the `class` keyword can be used, which is syntax sugar for the previous ways. 

This is much more similar to the equivalent Ruby. `constructor` is essentially the `initialize` method, and additional methods are added in a similar way to JSON.

```js
class Cat {
  constructor(legs) {
    this.legs = legs;
  }
  speak() {
    return "I have " + this.legs + " legs! Meow!";
  }
};

var cat = new Cat(4);
cat.speak(); // I have 4 legs! Meow!
```
