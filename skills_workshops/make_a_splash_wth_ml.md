# Make a Splash with Machine Learning - Zack Akil - Upskilling Talk

[All Workshops](README.md)

Zack's handle: @ZackAkil

## Objectives

- [x] Learn enough to know how to talk about it to anyone.
- [x] Key question to ask machine learning engineers.
- [x] Do some hands on machine learning.

## Background

Started as test engineer, went to machine learning meetups and did courses. Ran his own meetup. Google hired him to champion machine learning.

Small startups mean flexibility, in actual activities and in role title.

## Pragmatic Pet Projects ("Prajects")

Projects that you come up with to solve some problem.

Repetitive tasks that could be automated.

Because they are solely your own, you own te whole thing. Great as interview topics, and as learning process.

No business priority, therefore no risk if undelivered, no stress, just do it in your spare time.

There may be no correlation between the time it takes to make and its usefulness, make prajects as small as possible for the MVP.

People are more interested in joining an ongoing success, so tell them after the MVP.

Priorities are to learn something, and maybe do something useful (then you always win).

Mini branding for the praject to help it  

## Books

- The Pragmatic Programmer - helps identify when you can apply programming to solve problems.
- The Design of Everyday Things - if something is hard to use, it is poorly designed.
- Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow Paperback - great book.

Humans err often, so system designs should take that into account.

## Slaver vs Non Slavers

Go with Supervised learning if you have it. Tends to perform better.

AutoML natural language.

SpaCy can do word2vector, arranging it in a meaningful multidimensional space. To turn text to numbers.

SciKit learn for string. Search Zack's repos for "Clustering".
