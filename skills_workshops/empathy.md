## Notes

### What is Empathy?

The ability to sense other peoples emotions coupled with the ability to imagine what someone else may be thinking or feeling.

Different people have different working styles and speeds, understanding and not criticising differences is key.

Although we are doing technical work, we work with humans more often than not also. Without empathy, we are at a disadvantage in communication and learning.

Empathy is also important to understand UX and the needs of your customer.

### Reasons for missing Empathy

#### Anger

- Feel numb towards another's pain
- Contempt instead of warmth, lecture and scold

#### Protection

- Unconsciously feeling another's pain is "catching"

#### Identifying

- Their feelings are too close to home, bringing up your own issues
- Try to rationalise them out of their feelings/fix them in an attempt to avoid your own feelings

Fear of Intimacy

- Being emotionally distant seems easier than risking vulnerability

### Training the skill of Empathy

#### Just Like Me

- If someone is like you, or likes the same things, you will have more empathy towards them
- Look for things that you have in common

#### Metta Bhavana: Love and Kindness meditation

- You wish other people well
- Long term effects of this meditation are very beneficial

#### Empathetic Active Listening

- Reflect back
- Ask questions instead of giving answers
- Validate emotions (even if you disagree with logic)
- Don't offer unsolicited advice (if it is an appropriate time, ask if you can share advice)
- Be present (80/20 listening)
