## Notes

Understanding and delivering feedback well is very important for devs.

Help centre from Dana includes a bunch of FAQs and resources that Makers students often need.

### What is feedback

- For clarification
- Comes in many forms
- Letting someone know about the effect of their behaviour

Maker's definition:

Information about reactions to a product, a person's performance of a task, or behaviour, which is used as a basis for improvement.

### Feedback is difficult

Giving feedback:

- If feedback is negative, or overly critical, and doesn't provide a solution, that may make the receiver uncomfortable.
- If someone is feels criticised they can become defensive.
- A lot of the danger can be in offending people on your team, as they may over identify with their work, and feel ego attachment to it.
- Articulating your feedback can be hard.
- Worrying too much about making people feel bad can harm your ability to deliver useful informative feedback.

Receiving feedback:

- The attitude of the receiver is important too, they must want to take the feedback on board.
- We are our own harshest critics, feedback may poke those sore points.
- We put ourselves into our work, so when someone judges it, we may feel they are judging us.
- We have a natural resistance to change, feedback is given in order to encourage change.

Feedback balances between Love and connection and Growth

Six human needs:

- Love and connection
- Significance
- Certainty
- Uncertainty
- Growth
- Contribution

### Feedback is everywhere

All around us are pieces of feedback, with everyone we meet. With so much feedback we need to become resilient.

### Resilience Methods

#### Shift your perspective

- Practice seeing feedback as positive, as a basis for improvement, to help you learn and grow.
- See feedback as kind, doing it skilfully is a kind thing to do for someone.

#### Empowered receiver

- Most feedback is centred on giving feedback. The receiver should be in control though.
- People who seek feedback and want to improve find more success.
- Be the gatekeeper of feedback you receive.
- Practice boundaries and assertiveness. 
- Ask questions and challenge feedback. 

#### Know thyself

- Truth trigger: feedback seems wrong of off target.
- Relationship trigger: Something about our relationship with the person. Don't miss feedback due to biases of someone's credibility or status.
- Identity trigger: A lot of information can be biased, think about confirmation bias in google searches.
- Wrong spotting: We sift through feedback information in order to find what is wrong quickly, which hurts as we skip the good stuff.
- Blind spots: We see ourselves differently to how others see us. But do not change yourself to benefit anyone else, change for your own benefit.
- Understand your happiness: Do you swing from high to low, or are you more even keeled. How long does it take to return to baseline. [Measuring baseline happiness](http://www.happiness-survey.com).

#### Understand feedback

- Appreciation - acknowledge, motivate, connect, reassure, thank.
- Evaluation - rate against standards, align expectation, inform decision making.
- Coaching - help receiver expand knowledge, sharpen skill, improve capability.

#### Use a framework

- Actionable: avoid vague adjectives.
- Specific: use actual data, evidences.
- Kind: make the feedback palatable, to keep them on board and open.

#### Communication stances

- Doormat: being overly agreeable, stuffing things down.
- Sword: harsh aggressive communication.
- Lantern: equal adult-adult relationship, working together to uncover problems and solve them.

### Non violent communication

Step | Example
---|---
 Observation | When I hear/see...
 Feeling | I feel...
 Need | Because I need...
 Request | Would you be willing to...?

### Tips

- Check in with yourself beforehand, Purpose? Stance?
- Ask permission.

Receiving:

- Check right head-space, decline or postpone if you aren't ready.
- Know your feedback profile.
- Listen, open mind.
- Be aware of blind spots.
- Be aware of triggers.
- Weigh and respond.
- Know boundaries and reject after careful consideration.
- Let them know what you will do with accepted feedback.
